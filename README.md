🔍 What we’re testing
A very common workflow is the transfer of funds between accounts. We have two scenarios: one which creates all resources and successfully transfers funds, and one which tries the transfer with insufficient funds.
During these workflows, we are testing for data correctness, data types, and that data is successfully passed through the system during creation and retrieval.
